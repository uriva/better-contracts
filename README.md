# Better Contracts

## Motivation

Contracts in the startup world are too limiting.

They make it hard for people to collaborate freely on multiple projects. They imply all creations belong to an entity, sometimes even if they aren't related to it.

They make people time-prisoners, forbidding them from taking new commitments, or change their commitment level.

## Solution

Instead, we would like a system that:

- Allows an individual to collaborate with different people on different projects.
- Allows collaborators to dynamically determine how much of their week they dedicate to a project.
  Something personal came up? Lost interest? No problem, You can work less on that project.
- Does not glorify or give "the founders" any special status or rights.
  In my experience your importance to the project is not always a function of when you joined.
- Compensates collaborators on things that already happened, not speculation about what they will do.

This repo attempts to imagine what such a system might look like.

## FAQ

### Is this like Slicing Pie?

Yes, these contracts are inspired by Slicing Pie. To those unfamiliar, slicing pie is a method that tries to acheive these goals. It works like this:

- You agree with your collaborators on how much your hours are worth
- You treat hours put in the project as you would a monetary investment.
- Your share in the company is simply your contributions divided by everyone's.

### Is counting hours a good way to measure contribution?

While this removes the risk of bringing on a cofounder and giving him half of your project based on good intentions, hour reporting sounds weird. Are hours really what we want to compensate for? After all people can work for hours and not create any value.

The question however is what is the alternative? Some efforts do not create immediate value.

### What if someone just reports many hours, but not creating value?

If someone is putting in the time and not creating value, they should be terminated.

### Terminated? Isn't this a hippie cooperative?

This method still needs a clear supervisor for each collaborator. It is enough that the supervisor has the authority to terminate so it derives all other autorities. Each person should have exactly one supervisor. This means the company is run by one decision maker until the top. At the top you could make other kinds of agreements, e.g. a voting system between multiple top level managers, an outsider to tie-break 2 level managers etc'. So there is a clear way to compensate and a clear way to terminate.

### What are alternatives for counting hours?

Well you could count days as well ðŸ˜œ

But seriously here are some alternatives:

1. Tickets worth a certain amount of $
1. Work on open source
1. Share ownership over IP.

### What about roles?

If termination rights and compensation is agreed upon It is made redundant to decide on roles, at least within this framework.
