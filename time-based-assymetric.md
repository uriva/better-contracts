# Asymmetric collaborators contract

This contract outlines an asymmetric contract between existing collaborator (C1) and new collaborator (C2), whereas on the specific project C1 has already put in considerable work (e.g. months or years).

## Equity

Given that existing collaborator has put in: H1 hours, with cost of W1 per hour and new collaborator hour's worth is W2,

Then if at some point X is made into a company, and equity is distributed, the ratio between C1's equity and C2 will correspond H1*W1/H2*W2 (i.e. the ratio from now on), where H2 are hours put in by C2.

Also any monetary retribution (i.e. dividends) received by C1/C2 shall also correspond to this ratio.

If at any point X is incorporated, and a collaborator starts getting a salary for their time, this salary would be their compensation, and their time will not be compensated by additional equity anymore. The salaries should correspond to W1 and W2, so cannot be used to extract wealth arbitrarily.

If the ratio is too small to handle, i.e. C2's contribution is <1% of the project, then the work of C2 would be considered a contribution without compensation. This is to make it easy to "hire" people for a trial period, and to avoid overhead caused by low commitment collaborators.

## Decision making

Given C1 has invested considerably more time in X, if any differences of opinions between C1 and C2 shall transpire, C1 would have the final word on the project. To enforce this, C1 would be able to terminate C2's engagement of the project effective immediately, at which point C2 would yield rights to code, servers and so on. C1 however would not be able to modify C2's claim for equity as described above. If C2's investment in the project exceeds C1's, the two parties may renegotiate as they please, but are not obliged to do so.

## Recording time invested

C2 and C1 will report time invested in a shared spreadsheet. They will be able to appeal a written entry not long after W weeks after its submission. In case of a dispute, C1 will be able to terminate C2's engagement as described above, but will not be able to change previous entries which were not appealed.

## IP

Any IP created by C1 or C2 in the project repo would be considered belonging to project X, and cannot be copied or transferred without written consent. If C1 and C2 agree, code could be written in open source with MIT license, at which case anyone could do as they please with the code.

## Commitment

Neither C1 and C2 guarantee any minimal effort or time they intend to work on the project. They might also do work on anything else they choose to, as long as it is not in direct competition with the project during the time they are engaged with it.
