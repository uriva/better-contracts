# Simple symmetric

This contract allows a group of collaborators to start working on a project together without too much legal hassle.

Given that all parties are just testing the waters:

1. Parties are not obligated to invest any minimal amount of time in the project.
1. In case of dispute, all parties would have ownership over IP, and each could do with it as they please. This includes but is not limited to, code, customer contacts etc'.
1. In case of dispute, resources that cannot be duplicated/split between the collaborators will be distributed randomly.
